Script "run_analysis.R" reads two datasets (training and test data), merges them and uses only the mean values and the standard deviation values in the dataset for further calculation.
From these mean and standard deviation values the average is calculated and an output file named 'Tidy_data_final.txt' with these calculated averages is generated at the end.
The output file contains data of 30 test subjects. Each test subject has 6 sets of data with 66 variables(measurements).
The input files must be placed in a folder 'UCI HAR Dataset' in the working directory.
